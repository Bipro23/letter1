            In the last few days, what haven't I tried to get you out of my mind? 😔 I have tried meditation 🧘‍♂️, going to temples twice a day 🕉️, crying alone 😢, and staying alone. 😔 What haven't I tried to stop loving you? 💔 But after trying all of this, I haven't lost even 1% of my feelings for you. 😍 Instead, I've gained even stronger feelings. 🥰

I am determined to keep trying, no matter how long it takes. ⏳ I will make that one day when you will love me back, or even if God has to come down from heaven to request your love. 🙏❤️

Let me share that in these past few days, I have visited Kali Mandir 🌺, Shiv Mandir 🕉️, and, of course, Krishna Mandir 🌟. I have even made a deal with God to win your love:

He can use all my good karma from the past. 🌟
He can also use all my good karma in this life and in the afterlife, life after life. 🌠
I will stop eating my favorite food, which is chicken. 🐔❌
I will provide clothes and food to the poor. 👚🍲
I will plant more trees. 🌳
I will donate 101 rupees initially, and then continue giving larger amounts throughout my life. 💰
I will stop consuming gutka. 🚭
I am willing to do whatever He asks of me. 🙌

The deal isn't finalized yet; I am still in negotiations with God. 🤝 I love you, and you can't even begin to imagine how much. ❤️😘
