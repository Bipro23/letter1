        <h1>TEASER OF RELATIONSHIP?</h1>

            <!-- Add your writing here -->
            Here is a short version of how I can provide a relationship for you. First of all, let me tell you that expressing feelings in writing is tough for me, especially if I have to write it in English. 😊❤️

I want to give you a relationship where the little things matter the most, like going shopping with you and buying not just one jhumka, but a hundred of them. 💍💐 Sometimes, giving you a rose or two, or a bouquet of them. 🌹💐 Writing a letter for you with a plate of momo. 💌 Or we can sit by the roadside and do both of our favorite things: eating fast foods. 🍔🍟

We can also ride late at night, indulging in some playful mischief, teasing other couples in parks. 😄💑 Just imagine how much more fun we can have together. Or sometimes, just sitting near the Brahmaputra Ghat in Dibrugarh, enjoying the cool air coming from the riverside, and silently savoring the view, side by side. 🌅💕

We can travel on roads just to enjoy the sunset with an ice cream in our hands. 🌇🍦 I want to be your comfort zone. Believe me or not, I'm trying my level best to make this happen. 💖

What more can I do? I can bring cakes on your birthday with roses 🎂🌹, or I can bring pads, chocolates, and momos during your periods. Yes, I can do both for you. I can give you a forehead kiss when you're feeling low and say, 'I'm there for you.' 😘❤️ I love you in the purest form. I want to be your best friend with whom you can be yourself, no filters. 👫💬

I want to build a bond with you that no one can break and experience life with you. This is a very short version, but if you want to hear about all the things we can do together, just give me a call at night. I will take you to my world in my imagination where we live together happily. 🌌📞💫
